# Unstructured Document Processing with AWS Textract

This project implements an ingestion pipeline for processing unstructured documents such as pdfs, images or scanned documents using AWS Textract as the primary OCR and data extraction service.

## Overview

The ingestion pipeline uses AWS Textract to process:
- PDFs
- Scanned images (e.g., PNG, JPEG, TIFF)

Integration with AWS Textract is done using:
- AWS SDKs (e.g., Boto3 for Python)
- REST APIs

## Workflow

### Step 1: Upload to AWS S3
- PDFs and images are uploaded to a secure S3 bucket
- S3 triggers an AWS Lambda function for processing

### Step 2: Process with AWS Textract
AWS Textract extracts:
- Text blocks, key-value pairs, and tables
- Document structure (e.g., paragraphs, headers, forms)

### Step 3: Validation and Enrichment
- Post-extraction validation with custom rules (e.g., regex) or ML-based checks
- Metadata enrichment using extracted information

### Step 4: Save to Data Lake
- Store raw extracted text, metadata, and the original document in a Data Lake (e.g., AWS S3)
- Save structured and validated data to the Data Warehouse (e.g., AWS Redshift or Snowflake)

## Architecture Components

### Data Sources
- PDF and image files uploaded via:
  - User uploads (e.g., web interface)
  - Automated workflows (e.g., email ingestion, batch uploads)

### Ingestion
- AWS S3 for storage
- AWS Lambda triggers AWS Textract for OCR

### Extraction and Processing
AWS Textract extracts:
- Key-value pairs (e.g., "Taxpayer Name: John Doe")
- Table data (e.g., financial summaries in transfer pricing documents)

Text output is validated using:
- Rule-based checks for expected fields
- NLP models for tax-specific classification

### Storage
Raw files and extracted data saved to:
- Data Lake (AWS S3): Unstructured and semi-structured data
- Data Warehouse (e.g., Snowflake or Redshift): Processed and structured data

### Analytics and Automation
Use extracted data for:
- Generating transfer pricing documentation and audit reports
- Feeding into analytics platforms like Tableau or Power BI
- AI-based automation for report generation using tools like OpenAI or AWS Comprehend

## Integration with Transformation Layer

- AWS Textract outputs are converted into structured JSON or CSV for further processing
- These structured outputs feed into the ETL pipeline for data cleaning and formatting
